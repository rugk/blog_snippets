## What is a Pry plugin?

### Kinds of plugins

  - https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Available-plugins

#### Commands
  > As Commands are implemented in Ruby, there's an endless number of things that
  > they can be used to do. At the extreme end of the spectrum, the pry_nav plugin
  > adds "step", and "next" commands for walking through Ruby code. A more simple
  > example is provided by the pry-highlight plugin, which adds a single "highlight"
  > command to pretty-print JSON and XML.
